# Stack of Plates

## Cracking the Coding Interview

<br />

## Question

Imagine a stack of plates. If the stack gets too high then it will become unstable and topple over.

<br />

Therefore, when stacking plates we create a new stack after a certain number of plates.

<br />

Implement a data structure that mimics this behavior. `SetOfStacks` should be composed of several stacks and it should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds a certain threshold.

<br />

`SetOfStacks.push()` and `SetOfStacks.pop()` should behave identically to if the data structure was just a single stack.

  We'll design the class to have a `push` and `pop` method, so the API is identical to a normal stack.

  <br />

  In order to instantiate the class, the user will have the option of providing the capacity of the stacks. The capacity must be a positive number (greater than 0). We set the default capacity to an arbitrary number (we picked 10).

  <br />

  We will represent the data structure internally with a 2 dimensional list. Everytime one list reaches capacity, we'll add another.

  <br />

  The list allows us to do `push` and `pop` operations in $$O(1)$$ time.

  <br />

  With our `push` method, we first check to make sure that our current stack (the last list in our 2-D list) is not at capacity.

  <br />

  If it is, then we add a new empty list as our current stack.

  <br />

  Then, we can just append the value to our current stack.

  <br />

  In `pop`, we first check to make sure that there is at least one value in our data structure. If not, we throw an `IndexError`.

  <br />

  Otherwise, we can just pop the last value and return it.

  <br />
  
  
  ```python
  class SetOfStacks:
      def __init__(self, capacity = 10):
          if capacity < 1:
              raise ValueError("capacity must be at least 1")
          
          self.capacity = capacity
          self.stacks = [[]]
      
      def push(self, val):
          if len(self.stacks[-1]) == self.capacity:
              self.stacks.append([])
          
          self.stacks[-1].append(val)
      
      def pop(self):
          if len(self.stacks[-1]) == 0:
              if len(self.stacks) == 1:
                  raise IndexError("pop from empty stack")
              else:
                  self.stacks.pop()
          
          return self.stacks[-1].pop()
  ```

  <br />

  `push` and `pop` both take $$O(1)$$ time.
